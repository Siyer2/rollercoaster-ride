# Rollercoaster Security

## Some context

This is a really simple project. The main reason I'm giving you this is so we can have all the tools we need installed.

The next (and last) project we're working on is going to be SUPER cool and a lot more useful to the world.

## This project

We need to write a software to be the security in front of a rollercoaster ride. We need to only admit people if they're over 18 and over a certain height.

# Installation instructions

## Install Git

### Windows:

1. Go to [this URL](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.36.1.windows.1)
2. Scroll down and under `Assets`, click `Git-2.36.1-32-bit.exe`
3. A Git Setup Wizard screen will appear. Follow the instructions to set it up.

To confirm it's been installed correctly, do this:

1. Open your `Command Prompt` (you can find this by doing a search for an application called Command Prompt, it'll be already installed on your computer).
2. Type in `git --version` and then hit Enter
3. It should say something like this:

```
git version 2.32.1
```

### Mac:

You have a few options. You can install [XCode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) from the Mac App Store but it is a huge install. If you don't have the space, do this:

1. [Click this URL](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/git-2.33.0-intel-universal-mavericks.dmg/download) and it will start to install.
2. Open the installed files
3. Right click on the .pkg file and click open (doubleclicking on the file won't work)
4. Because this wasn't installed from the Mac App Store it'll give you a warning saying it's from the Internet. If you are worried about this, I recommend installing with XCode through the App Store.
5. Follow the installation instructions.

To confirm it's been installed correctly, do this:

1. Open your `Terminal` (you can find this by doing a Spotlight search for an application called Terminal, it'll be already installed on your computer).
2. Type in `git --version` and then hit Enter
3. It should say something like this:

```
git version 2.32.1 (Apple Git-133)
```
